Good morning Hackers,  I am Ritesh and one of the mentors this year. 


I have spent a good amount of time building electric two wheelers across multiple startups in Asia.  My expertise ranges from product design/development, systems design,  data science, iot and embedded systems.  I have worked with R, python, C/C++, golang, Matlab etc and should be able to help debug. 

I’ll be around at the HUB, so feel  free to reach out and I will be happy to help.
